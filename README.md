## Chronic Kidney Disease Classification

**Objective:**
Classify whether a patient is likely to develop chronic kidney disease based on clinical and demographic data.

### Features
- Data preprocessing and exploration
- Model training and evaluation
- Jupyter notebook for interactive analysis

---

## Cab Ride Cancellation Classification

**Objective:**
Develop a model to identify, based on booking details, whether a cab ride will be cancelled or not. This helps the company proactively manage cancellations and implement a penalty system for riders who frequently cancel rides. The penalty collected from riders will be distributed to affected customers as compensation.

### Features
- Data analysis of imbalanced classes
- Predictive modeling for ride cancellation
- Business logic for penalty and compensation
- Jupyter notebook for step-by-step workflow

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/debuggerrr/MachineLearningProblemsAndSolutions.git
	cd MachineLearningProblemsAndSolutions
	```
2. **Install dependencies:**
	- Recommended: Use a Python virtual environment (e.g., `venv` or `conda`).
	- Install required packages (see notebook for details).


3. **Run the notebooks:**
	- For kidney disease: Open `classification/kidney/kidney_disease.ipynb` in Jupyter or VS Code.
	- For cab cancellation: Open `classification/cab_cancellation/YourCabs_Imbalanced_Classes_Project.ipynb` in Jupyter or VS Code.
	- Follow the steps in each notebook to explore data and train models.


## Datasets

- **Chronic Kidney Disease:** The dataset is included or referenced in the notebook. See instructions in the notebook for details.
- **Cab Cancellation:** The dataset (`YourCabs.csv`) is provided in the `classification/cab_cancellation/` directory. Refer to the notebook for usage and details.
