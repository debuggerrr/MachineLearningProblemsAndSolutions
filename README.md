## Chronic Kidney Disease Classification

**Objective:**
Classify whether a patient is likely to develop chronic kidney disease based on clinical and demographic data.

### Features
- Data preprocessing and exploration
- Model training and evaluation
- Jupyter notebook for interactive analysis

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/debuggerrr/MachineLearningProblemsAndSolutions.git
	cd MachineLearningProblemsAndSolutions
	```
2. **Install dependencies:**
	- Recommended: Use a Python virtual environment (e.g., `venv` or `conda`).
	- Install required packages (see notebook for details).

3. **Run the notebook:**
	- Open `classification/kidney/kidney_disease.ipynb` in Jupyter or VS Code.
	- Follow the steps in the notebook to explore data and train models.

## Dataset

The dataset used for chronic kidney disease classification is included or referenced in the notebook. Please refer to the notebook for download instructions or data source links.
